# Information About Brain MRI Dataset

* This brain tumor dataset containing 3064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images from 233 patients with three kinds of brain tumor: 
    i. Meningioma (708 slices),  
    ii. Glioma (1426 slices), and  
    iii. Pituitary Tumor (930 slices). 

* This data is organized in MATLAB data format (.mat file). Each file stores a struct containing the following fields for an image:

```
cjdata.label: 1 for meningioma, 2 for glioma, 3 for pituitary tumor
cjdata.PID: patient ID
cjdata.image: image data
cjdata.tumorBorder: a vector storing the coordinates of discrete points on tumor border.
		For example, [x1, y1, x2, y2,...] in which x1, y1 are planar coordinates on tumor border.
		It was generated by manually delineating the tumor border. So we can use it to generate
		binary image of tumor mask.
cjdata.tumorMask: a binary image with 1s indicating tumor region
```

* This data was used in the following papers:
	1. Cheng, Jun, et al. "Enhanced Performance of Brain Tumor Classification via Tumor Region Augmentation and Partition." PloS one 10.10 (2015).
	2. Cheng, Jun, et al. "Retrieval of Brain Tumors by Adaptive Spatial Pooling and Fisher Vector Representation." PloS one 11.6 (2016).
